00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:20.603
Iceberg! Right ahead!

2
00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.032
Titanic was called,
''The Ship of Dreams''.

3
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.720
And it was. It really was.

4
00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:33.256
All right. Open your eyes.

5
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.361
We go full ahead!
Put your backs into it!

6
00:00:47.903 --> 00:00:52.257
Got everything I need right here with me.
I figure life's a gift and I don't intend on wasting it.

7
00:00:54.918 --> 00:00:57.195
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

8
00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:00.098
You learn to take life
as it comes at you.

9
00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.297
When the ship docks,
I'm getting off with you.

10
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.468
God Almighty!

11
00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:51.934
This is it!
Hold on !

12
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.238
Oh, God! Oh, God!

13
00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:57.263
Do not let go of my hand.

14
00:01:58.406 --> 00:01:59.711
I'll never let go.
