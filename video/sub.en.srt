1
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,354
I don't know, Nick.
You're the accountant.

2
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,795
- These books...
- Yeah, I know.

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,598
- Hello?
- I'm not sure.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,752
Hello, there! Excuse me!

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,195
I just wonder if... Hel...

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,999
It'll be different this time.
Honestly.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,230
The accounts are in order.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,869
OK. I'll see you in an hour. OK. Bye.

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,269
- Now...
- Those books, how much?

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,669
- Hm?
- The leather-bound books.

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,479
The Collected Works
of Charles Dickens.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,030
- They're real leather?
- They're real Dickens.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,999
I have to know because
they have to go with a sofa.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,834
Everything else in my house is real.
I'll give you 200.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,639
- 200 what?
- £200.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,154
Are they leather-bound pounds?

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,709
- No.
- They won't go with my wallet.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,472
Next!

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,998
- Hello!
- Hello.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,117
I need The Little Book of Calm,
do you have it?

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,078
I'm late for work. Uh, Calm...

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,276
Er, is this it?

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,828
No, no, it's just...
Too big, too big.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,592
Little... just little...

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,717
- This one, this?
- No! No, calm.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,234
- The Little Book of Calm.
- Er, this?

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,992
That's the one! Yes!

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,957
- Two-fifty.
- Two-fifty...

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,634
- Could...
- I'll just get you a bag.

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,915
No, no - no bag, just the book!

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,992
- I'll do you a receipt.
- No, that's fine!

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,949
It's broken. I'll write one.
Little...

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,715
I'll do it!
Calm, two-fifty. Thank you.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,553
(Muttering frantically)

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,070
"Let-let-let go once in a while,

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,436
"you are a loose lily
floating down an amber river."

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,596
Sorry. I hate my job.
